# PT-ModManager

 A mod manager for Pizza Tower and made in GameMaker, because why not.
 
 Currently very incomplete, and I really do mean it (if the name being PT-ModManager isn't a sign of that), so I don't recommend touching it if you simply want to use it.

# Building
Just open it in GameMaker-LTS and the rest you can figure out yourself.
